### Questions (Only the ones I had to google or found interesting)
---

gobuster:
use `-x` to specify a suffix/extension
use `-k` to skip ssl certificate verification
use `-a` to specify a user agent

---
nikto (not a tool I have used before):
host: `-h`
disable ssl: `-nossl`
ssl: `-ssl`
specify auth: `-id id:pass[:realm]`
plugin: `-Plugins`
list plugins:`--list-plugins`

Basic CTF

IP opens to a default apache page

Used gobuster to search for additional directories
found `/secret/`

Opened a new gobuster session searching for extra directories
`found /secret/secret.txt`
found a hash
`nyan:046385855FC9580393853D8E81F240B66FE9A7B8`

cracked the hash (jtr was faster)
password: `nyan`

ssh'd into the IP

user flag:
`supernootnoot`

user could sudo su with no password

root flag:
`congratulations!!!!`
