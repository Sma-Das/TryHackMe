# TryHackMe's Basic Pentesting Room

IP=10.10.121.203


nmap -sV -sC

Using gobuster:
`/development/`
`/server-status/`

At this point I got stuck with how to get their usernames, I then checked a writeup to see which tool they had used.
The user had used enum4linux which I proceeded to download and try setup, only to fail when it had linux specific requirements I could not install on my mac

So I simply stole the two usernames from the writeup and continued with the usernames:
`jan` -> weak password hash from the dev note
`kay`

Using hydra to brute force ssh with rockyou.txt as my wordlist
`jan:armando`
---
new IP=`10.10.0.20`

Used linpeas to discover private ssh key for kay

Copied and pasted that into a new file `id_rsa_kay`
But when running: `ssh -i id_rsa_kay kay@10.10.0.20` it requests a passphrase for the key

Using ssh2john and then john to crack the hash
`beeswax`
logging in as kay followed by
`cat pass.bak`
and that's the room complete!
