### Finding vulnerabilities

Exploring the site we can see that it is a Wordpress site, therefore we can fire up wpscan to enumerate the site for us (and skip gobuster).

```bash
wpscan --url http://blog.thm -e vp,vt,u
```

```

We now have two users that we can try to brute-force passwords with. I decided to continue using wpscan to brute-force rather than hydra because it is less of a hassle.

```bash
wpscan --url http://blog.thm -U kwheel -P ~/wordlists/passwords/rockyou.txt
wpscan --url http://blog.thm -U bjoel -P ~/wordlists/passwords/rockyou.txt
```

Now that we have those running, I decided to check out the smb files I could access

```bash
smbclient.py  $IP
> use "<<SHARE>>"
> get Alice-White-Rabbit.jpg check-this.png tswift.mp4
```

I used an online `steg unhide` on `Alice-White-Rabbit.jpg` and was returned the message that:

`You've found yourself in a rabbit hole, friend.`

I try scanning the `check-this.png` to be greated by a Billy Joel song (not a rickroll this time thankfully)

And the Taylor Swift video, I didn't even bother...because by now our brute-forcer had a match for `kwheel`!

Now that we have a password, I check the website if we are an admin but unfortunately not. Instead I use `searchsploit` to check what vulnerabilities we can exploit on WordPress version 5.0.0

```

I first tried to use `php/webapps/49512.py` but I just could not figure out how to execute code via the exiftool (something to learn) so instead I cheaped out and decided to fire up `msfconsole` (metasploit).

I search for the Crop-image shell upload (from searchsploit earlier) and set up the parameters for that. Note that you must use the _**IP**_ address and not `blog.thm` as your RHOST.

Running `exploit`...and we are in!

I don't like the metasploit terminal interface so I launch a shell with `shell` and then stabilise it with:

```bash
python -c "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
```

And now we can navigate around as `www-data`.
I navigate to `/tmp` and grab linpeas off my machine to easily enumerate the system.

When examining programs which have their `SUID` set, we notice that there is a strange program `checker` which seems to run some sort of code that launches a shell.

We know this from running `ltrace` on `checker` to see what resources it is accessing

It checks in the environment for a variable `admin` and spawns the shell according to a value of that.

```bash
export admin=1
```

And run that program... and we're root!

We can nab the root flag but that leaves the user flag which is not in its usual place.

Now I can do one of two things to find it. I can do a search based on the assumption that the real user flag is still named `user.txt`

```bash
find / -type f -name user.txt -exec cat "{}" \;
```

And that _will work_ for this box but I instead used:

```bash
find / -regex "/...../..."
```

Since we know from the questions hint what format the directory is in and as it turns out, there is only one directory with this format: `/media/usb` from which we can now grab `user.txt`!

And this box is complete!!
