# Searchlight - IMINT [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/searchlightosint)

### Task 1:

`sl{ready}`

---

### Task 2:

`sl{carnaby street}`

---

### Task 3:

`sl{london}`

`sl{piccadilly circus}`

`sl{1906}`

`sl{4}`

---

### Task 4:

\* All you need to do is google the really obvious text in this - no need for google dorking, yet

`sl{vancouver international airport}`

`sl{canada}`

`sl{richmond}`

---

### Task 5:

Again, search the obvious name in google maps and find the building that looks most similar to it.

After a bit of searching and mild luck, I found [it](shorturl.at/dlvMR).

`sl{blairgowrie}`

`sl{allan street}`

`sl{+447878839128}`

`sl{theweecoffeeshop@aol.com}`

`sl{cochrane}`

---

### Task 6:

I just used a few image reverse searching websites to enumerate the picture are best as possible.

`sl{Katz's Deli}`

`sl{Andrew Knowlton}`

---

### Task 7:

Easily the easiest and most annoying one. Finding the photographer was a pain

`sl{Rudolph the Chrome Nosed Reindeer}`

`sl{Kjersti Stensrud}`

---

### Task 8:

Kicking it off with a simple google reverse image search, we find the name of the court house it is from. Hint, not ryan but bryan...

`sl{lady justice}`

`sl{alexandria virginia}`

`sl{The westin alexandria old town}`

---

### Task 9:

The hotel does not exist anymore. I quickly found the location of the place but when trying to search hotels there, no results were found.
I then grabbed the address for that place and searched that along with hotels and found the answer.

`sl{novotel singapore clarke quay}`
