We need two large primes `p` and `q` 
`n = pq`

The Euler Totient Function is represented by `Φ(x)`
`Φ(n)` = to the numbers between 1 and n that are coprime to n
    - coprime: two numbers with their common factors only equal to 1

The totient function is typically difficult to calculate, however, in the case of
